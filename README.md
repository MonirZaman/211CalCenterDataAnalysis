# 211 Call Center Data Analysis
I participated in an express datathon that lasted for a day and was organized by DataForGood meetup group. 
Our group studied <a href="http://www.ab.211.ca/">Alberta 211 call center</a> dataset and combined it with the weather data to find correlation between the type of weather and caller's objective/issues. Results of the analysis is in this <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~mmoniruz/blog/team4Presentation.pdf">PDF report</a>. 

This repository contains the code as R markdown that used in the analysis. Send me an email regarding dataset 
at mznDOTmunnaATgmailDOTcom.
